Hi

I need some Python coding done.

I have CSV files.

I want code to go through the CVS files and reformat.

Find attached 2 files.

One file is the format I need.
The other is a format that I need to convert called 'Bad format.csv'.

I need to have quotes and heading renamed.

I want to have a 3rd CSV mapping file.
Here, we remap heading names.
This will have 2 columns say.
We might have for example:

User Id:Transaction ID

So the 'Transaction ID' will get changed to 'User ID' in the new fiule generated.

The code goes through and renames titles if a match is found.
If none found, then it's left as it is.

We ALSO need to have the same order of titles as the first CSV - for columns that have matching names.

The output MUST be *exactly* the same as the correct file format file 'Format needed.csv'.
This has quote marks in the CSV files. As far as I know, this is the only difference.
Other places where we have comma characters - these need to be removed in the new file.

The bottom part of the good version of the file has an email address. The bad format doesn't have an email address, instead has an ID. Here, just add @gmail at the end of the ID in the new file.

The new file generated should have the file name format 'fixed.ABC Test file.csv' - i.e. we add 'fixed' to the front of the file name.

They code should work with many files, processing files one at a time and generating the new file formats.

The code will be called EXACTLY like this:

"F:\My Python Code\First DIR\Second Dir\python-code\Development verion\myscript.py" "F:\My Python Code\First DIR\Second Dir\Data\abc test.csv" "F:\My Python Code\First DIR\Second Dir\Data\Yet Another File.csv" "F:\My Python Code\First DIR\Second Dir\Data\Another file.csv" "F:\My Python Code\First DIR\Second Dir\Data\XYZ File.csv" "Custom Label"
