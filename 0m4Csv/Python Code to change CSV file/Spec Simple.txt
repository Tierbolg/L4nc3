I need some Python code to reformat a CSV file - simply add quotation marks around fields and make the file same as another file (that involves getting rid of empty rows with commas).

There is a small complexity: if a field already has quote marks around, then don't add quote marks - just leave as is.

+ at the end, there is an ID, I need to change that ID to an email address.

The output file needs to be called 'fixed.original file name.csv' - i.e. have 'fixed' added in front.

Also, the code needs to execute on 1 or more files.
So, I would call like this:

"my script.py" ''file 1.csv" "number 2.csv" "my third file.csv"

Only looking to pay the basic fee. Assuming the work is simple. Let me know if you can help.

The 2 files attached shows what's needed.
